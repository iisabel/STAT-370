# STAT-370
Final project for STAT 370 (Data Science Consulting).

My consulting partner and I were tasked with cleaning and analyzing data from the computer science department at Loyola University Chicago. We were given 4 years worth of grades from an Intro to Java class. The goal was to assign each student a "Bloom's Taxonomy Score" based on their grade and performance on the "Top Ten Knowledge Areas" that they teach in this Java class. Our overall goal was to create a mixed-effects model to show which topics are correlated with one another, and what factors (professor, semester, class section, etc.) make students perform the best.
